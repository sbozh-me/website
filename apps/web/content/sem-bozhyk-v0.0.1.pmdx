Hi Stefania,

Thanks for reaching out — CoinLocator caught my attention immediately.

Real estate + staking + governance? I just spent a year at Rock.estate building property platforms for BENELUX market. Before that, I led payment systems processing €5M+ monthly. Your project sits exactly at the intersection of what I've done and where I want to go.

## Why Me

**Real estate is my current domain.** At Rock.estate, I built interfaces for 100K+ property workflows — smart forms, data-intensive UX for valuation specialists. I fell in love with this industry. It's rare, complex, and ripe for disruption. Tokenized real estate feels like the natural next step.

**I build systems that handle money.** At GR8 Tech, I led a team processing €5M+ monthly payments — 99.99% uptime, 23% reduction in payment failures. At Cloudbeds, I shipped PCI-compliant payment interfaces. Transaction reliability isn't abstract to me; it's what I do.

**Web3 is personal, not just professional.** I hold crypto, stake ETH and USDC, believe in Near Protocol. I built an algo trading platform and I'm currently rebuilding it to work with DEX/CEX. I don't have commercial Web3 on my CV yet — but I'm not starting from zero.

**I believe we're early.** Web3 is the natural future of the internet. We're pioneers of something the world will use daily. I don't know when — but it's already happening.

## What I Bring

- Real estate platform experience (Rock.estate, 100K+ properties)
- High-volume transaction systems (€5M+ monthly, 99.99% uptime)
- Real-time state management, WebSockets, complex UI
- Team leadership and mentoring (40% velocity increase)
- Startup DNA: built VVLEN to €250K revenue from scratch

## Why CoinLocator

Staking, swaps, governance for tokenized real estate — this is exactly where my experience and interests collide. I'm open to part-time or full-time

You can learn more about how I think at [sbozh.me](https://sbozh.me) — my personal startup where I build in public.

Looking forward to talking.

Best,
Sem Bozhyk
