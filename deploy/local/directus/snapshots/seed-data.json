      "content": "This is the story of how a simple idea became something more.\n\n## The Beginning\n\nIt all started with a question: what if I built something just for me?\n\n### The First Commit\n\nEvery project starts somewhere. Here's how I set up the initial structure:\n\n```typescript\n// packages/blog/src/index.ts\nexport type { Post, Persona, Tag } from \"./types\";\nexport { MockBlogRepository } from \"./data\";\nexport { Timeline, PostCard, FilterBar } from \"./components\";\n\n// Simple, clean exports. Everything a blog needs.\n```\n\nI kept it minimal. No over-engineering, no premature optimization.\n\n```bash\npnpm create turborepo@latest\npnpm add -D typescript vitest\npnpm test\n```\n\nGreen tests from day one. That's the way.\n\n## The Journey\n\nBuilding in public has its challenges, but also its rewards.\n\nThe architecture emerged naturally:\n\n```tsx\nimport { Timeline, FilterBar } from \"@sbozh/blog\";\n\nfunction BlogPage({ posts, personas, tags }) {\n  const { filters, setFilter } = usePostFilters();\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <FilterBar\n        personas={personas}\n        tags={tags}\n        filters={filters}\n        onFiltersChange={setFilter}\n      />\n      <Timeline posts={posts} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nClean. Composable. TypeScript all the way.\n\n## What's Next\n\nThe roadmap is clear, the vision is set. Let's build.",
