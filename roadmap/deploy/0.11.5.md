# 0.11.5 - Environment Configuration

## Goal
Configure Next.js .env.local for production domains.

## Deliverables
- [x] Migrate AnalyticsProvider to use /api/config (runtime config)
- [x] Update middleware CSP to use UMAMI_SCRIPT_URL (no NEXT_PUBLIC_)
- [x] Clean up .env.example - removed NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars
- [x] Document required environment variables

## Notes
- Directus was already correct (uses server-side DIRECTUS_URL)
- All NEXT_PUBLIC_* analytics vars removed
- Single source of truth: docker-compose env vars → /api/config → client
