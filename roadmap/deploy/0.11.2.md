# 0.11.2 - GitOps

## Goal
Simple GitOps: deploy manifest YAML controls what version runs on server.

## Deliverables
- [x] Create deploy manifest YAML (deploy/production/manifest.yaml)
- [x] GitHub Action to compare manifest with deployed version
- [x] Auto-reload docker-compose when versions mismatch
- [x] Trigger deploy after image build for tagged versions (in case if deploy/production/manifest.yaml was changed)
