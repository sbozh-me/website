# 0.10.2 - Privacy Controls Styling

## Goal
Update privacy page controls to match cookie consent modal styling.

## Deliverables
- [x] Update PrivacyControls to match modal design (compact, no individual borders)
- [x] Apply consistent styling (bg-muted, border-border, rounded-lg)

## Implementation

### Simplified Approach
Instead of tabs, kept the single-page layout but updated the cookie controls component to visually match the modal for consistency.

### Changes
- Wrapped controls in styled container matching modal aesthetic
- Made control rows more compact
- Removed redundant footer text
