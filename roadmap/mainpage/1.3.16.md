# 1.3.16 - Blog Filters Working

## Goal

Fully functional blog filtering by author with smooth transitions and error handling.

## Deliverables

- [ ] Author switching updates blog posts (filtered by author)
- [ ] Smooth transition animation for posts
- [ ] "View all posts" link with author filter param
- [ ] Empty state for no posts
- [ ] Error handling and recovery
- [ ] Performance optimization (prefetch)

## Implementation

### Author Switching Flow

1. User clicks carousel arrow
2. Carousel slides to new author (animation)
3. Blog posts fade out
4. Fetch posts for new author's slugs
5. Blog posts fade in with new content

### View All Link

Links to `/blog?author=slug` for filtered view.

### Empty State

```tsx
<div className="text-center py-8">
  <p className="text-muted-foreground">
    No posts from this author yet.
  </p>
  <Link href="/blog" className="text-primary hover:underline">
    View all posts
  </Link>
</div>
```

### Performance

- Prefetch posts for adjacent authors
- Client-side cache for visited authors
- Skeleton loading states
