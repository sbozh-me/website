description: Interview to add cognitive context with Garret [topic]
---

Use the garret-cognitive-interviewer agent to help document and organize project knowledge.

The user's input after `/garret` is the topic or context they want to discuss with Garret.

Examples:

- `/garret testing approach` - Interview about testing patterns
- `/garret deployment workflow` - Document deployment process
- `/garret error handling` - Discuss error handling patterns
- `/garret` - Start general interview about what to document

Pass the user's prompt to Garret so he knows what topic to focus on during the interview.

If no topic is provided, Garret should ask what the user wants to document or explore.
